# CSE-158
Final Project for *CSE 158 - Recommender System and Data Mining* where we identify a dataset to perform exploratory analysis and 
build Machine Learning models to make a meaningful prediction. 

For our team, we experience with multiple Machine Learning Models on a fitness dataset called Endomondo to make personalized exercise duration prediction.
In particular, we predict the performance, or average time duration, of a userâ€™s next exercise given a specific route (a sequence of longitude, latitude, altitude) 
and the sport they will engage in.
